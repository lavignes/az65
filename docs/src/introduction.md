# Introduction

AZ65 is a powerful but simple 6502 macro assembler. Its primary goal is to be a
full-featured assembler for programming the Nintendo Entertainment System, but
its features allow it to function as a general-purpose 6502 assembler.

This book will cover the usage of the assembler and its features. Note that this
book will not cover the basics of 6502 programming. The assembler uses standard
mnemonics for all 6502 instructions and will gloss over them, instead focusing
on features unique to ASM65.

[6502.org](https://6502.org/tutorials) is the best resource for learning the
basics of 6502 assembly. If the 6502 assembly language is new to you, start
there first.
