# Introduction

AZ65 is a powerful but simple 6502 macro assembler. In this book you'll learn
the ins-and-outs of the assembler and its advanced meta-programming
capabilities.

Note that this book only covers using AZ65 and does not cover 6502 assembly
in general. The tutorials on [6502.org](https://6502.org/tutorials) are a good
place to start learning the basics of 6502 assembly before going further in
this book.
