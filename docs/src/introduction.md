# Introduction

AZ65 is a powerful but simple assembler for the Zilog Z80, MOS 6502, and Sharp
LR35902 (sm83 / gbz80) architectures. In this book you'll learn the ins-and-outs
of the assembler and its advanced meta-programming capabilities.

Note that this book only covers using AZ65 and does not cover assembly
in general.

For assembly language references see:

* [z80.info](https://z80.info/) for lots of z80 resources.
* [6502.org](https://6502.org/tutorials) for plenty of 6502 tutorials.
* [gbdev.io](https://gbdev.io/resources.html#programming) for resources on 
  sm83/gbz80 programming
