# Simple Directives

In assembly languages, "directives" are special commands that are used to
control the behavior of the assembler. AZ65 directives are special tokens that
begin with an at-sign (`@`).

There are two kinds of directives in AZ65: "simple" and "macro-like" directives.
We'll cover the simple directives first since they are just like directives
found in most other assemblers.
